/*TipService (DIP Compliant)

Steps:
    1. Create one low-level worker object that
       produces a tip.
    2. Create a second, but different type of low-level
       worker that also produce a tip, using the same
       method as in #1 above.
    3. Create an abstraction (interface) to represent both
       worker objects.
    4. Create the high-level module (boss) that gives
       order to worker components that are stored in the
       high-level model, based on abstraction. Call this a
       "-----Service"
